    <h1>The BEST Movies according to Momwolf</h1>
    <h2>My TOP 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>The Harry Potter series</h3>
    <h4> An average score of 7,68 on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000671664/">IMDb!</a></h4>
    <p> Well, okay that's not one movie, but I just can't decide given I'm obsessed with the series both books and movies. Wizards and witches, adventures, mighty creatures, awesome storyline: I love it!</p>
    <h3>The Tolkien films</h3>
    <h4> More than <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls046061223/?sort=list_order,asc&st_dt=&mode=detail&page=1&release_date=2001%2C&ref_=ttls_ref_yr">1000 minutes</a> of pure entertainment!</a></h4>
    <p>Yes, all 6 of them original LOTR's and Hobbits! Beautifully constructed, adventurous, exciting.</p>
    <h3>Our flag means death</h3>
    <h4><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11000902/?ref_=tt_mv_close">MAX</a> original production!</h4>
    <p>It was supposed to be The Pirates of the Caribbean, but you know, what? THIS series have everything and more. I was heartbroken when I found out, there won't be a 3rd season as it was meant to be originally.</p>
